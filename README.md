### Description

Since PSC removed my previous post of this screen saver for download problems...(?), I repost it.

This screensaver represents the falling caracters of the matrix movie in 3D. It uses DirectX 8.1

The source code of the previous version (3.0b) had been translated in english. This version is an update (3.2) I never released on PSC. So this one is in french... sorry for english-only coders...

But !... you can still download the previous version from my server at this address : http://www.open-design.be/dev/Matrix_Fall_3.0b_en.zip

enjoy !

ps : sorry for the screenshot's size ;), I don't have the time to download a screenshot utility and make a new one

ps2 : I switched to c++ and guess what ? I made an other screensaver of matrix but in C++ this time.

The result is: performances increased and a new effect... you can download it from psc at this address : http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=8854&lngWId=3
